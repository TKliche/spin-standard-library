Description:

Provides clock timing functions to:
  • Set clock mode and frequency at run-time using similar clock setting constants as with
    the _clkmode system constant; like the constant: xtal1_pll16x
  • Pause execution in units of microseconds, milliseconds, or seconds 
  • Synchronize code to the start of time-windows in units of microseconds, milliseconds,
    or seconds.

Example of Use:
  
    OBJ                                                 
      clk : "system.clock"           ' Include Clock object in parent object
      
    PUB Main
      clk.Init(5_000_000)            ' Initialize Clock object with external frequency 5 MHz
      <...>
      clk.SetMode(XTAL1_PLL2X)       ' Switch system clock to gain 1 and 2x wind-up (10 MHz)
      <...>
      clk.PauseMS(100)               ' Pause for approximately 100 ms
      <...>     

See "Theory of Operation" below for more information.

{{------------------------------------REVISION HISTORY-------------------------------------
 v1.1 - Updated 11/27/2006 to fix clock mode value when new mode is XINPUT.
 v1.2 - Updated 07/14/2012 to fix oscillator start-up delay bug that prevented proper
        operation in certain cases.  Also, heavily revised to make setting the clock mode
        12x faster, code smaller, and made the object conform to the Gold Standard.  Added
        the SetMode method.  Deprecated the SetClock method.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This object is used to control the system clock function (mode and speed) as well as code
execution (pauses and time-window synchronization).

Normally, clock mode and speed is fixed and set at compile-time with clock setting
constants such as:

      _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x   'standard mode and  
      _xinfreq = 5_000_000        'frequency (80 MHz)                        

However, the Propeller allows clock mode and speed changes at run-time for flexible power
management.  However, the CLKSET command doesn't accept the same clock setting constants
used by _CLKMODE, above, but rather takes the specific CLK Register values representing
the desired mode.

This object was written for those that would rather use the same clock setting constants
they are familiar with from the _CLKMODE constant.

TO PAUSE EXECUTION BRIEFLY:
    A pause is a simple delay usually meant to work within the human timeframe; noticeable
    delays a human can detect, but not accurate enough for the synchronization of signals.
    If accuracy is critical, use the technique in "To Synchronize...", below, instead.                                                                                  
          
    STEP 1: Call PauseUSec, PauseMSec, or PauseSec to pause for durations in units of
            microseconds, milliseconds, or seconds, respectively.

    NOTE: The Pause methods automatically do the following:
          • Adjusts for System Clock changes so that their duration is consistent as long
            as the System Clock frequency does not change during a pause operation itself.
          • Adjusts the specified duration down to compensate for the Spin Interpreter
            overhead of calling the method, performing the delay, and returning from the
            method.  This is so the effect of a Pause statement is a delay that is as close
            to the desired delay as possible, rather than being the desired delay plus the
            call/return delay.  The actual length of the delay will vary slightly depending
            on the expression used for the duration.
          • Limits the minimum duration to a "Spin Interpreter" safe value that will not
            cause apparent "lock ups" associated with waiting for a System Counter value
            that has already passed.  This limit code looks like "#> WMIN" and is noted in
            code comments as "freeze-protected", meaning it's well-protected against issues
            of this type.

    Keep in mind that System Clock frequency can greatly affect the shortest durations that
    are possible and clock source accuracy will affect duration accuracy.  For example, in
    Spin code, while running at 80 MHz, the shortest duration for PauseUSec is about 54
    (54 microseconds), but beyond that minimum, it can reliably delay for 55 µs, 56 µs,
    57 µs, etc.  When running as RCSLOW (ideally 20 KHz), the shortest duration is about
    216 (216 milliseconds), but beyond that minimum, using PauseMSec it can delay for about
    217 ms, 218 ms, etc.; however, the RCSLOW and RCFAST clock sources are never ideal for
    accurate timing and can vary wildly from chip to chip, and even within the session of an
    application as environmental temperatures change. 

                                                                       
    
TO SYNCHRONIZE A COMMAND/ROUTINE TO A WINDOW OF TIME (SYNCHRONIZED DELAYS):                                               
    A synchronized delay is an advanced timing mechanism used to accurately synchronize a
    specific command to the start of a defined window of time, and repeat that alignment
    perfectly over multiple loops.  If accuracy or synchronization is not critical, using
    the pause technique shown in "To Pause Execution Briefly", above, may be appropriate.                                                                                  
      
    STEP 1: Call MarkSync to mark the reference point in time.

    STEP 2: Call WaitSyncUSec, WaitSyncMSec, or WaitSyncSec immediately before the
            command/routine you wish to synchronize, to wait for the start of the next
            window of time (measured in units of microseconds, milliseconds, or seconds,
            respectively).
         
    NOTE: The WaitSync methods automatically do the following:
          • Adjusts for System Clock changes so that their time-window width is consistent
            as long as the System Clock frequency does not change during a wait operation
            itself.
          • Limits the minimum width to a "Spin Interpreter" safe value that will not cause
            apparent "lock ups" associated with waiting for a System Counter value that has
            already passed.  Noted in code comments as "freeze-resistant," meaning it has
            simple (but not fool-proof) protection against developer oversights. 
          
    In loops, the MarkSync/WaitSync methods (Synchronized Delays) have an advantage over
    the Pause methods in that they automatically compensate for the loop's overhead so that
    the command following the WaitSync executes at the exact same interval each time, even
    if the loop itself has multiple decision paths that each take different amounts of time
    to execute.


    
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAUSE AND WAIT METHODS:    
    The following code uses PauseUSec in a loop that toggles a pin.  Note that "clk" is the
    nickname given to this Clock object and we are using an accurate, external clock source.

          dira[16]~~
          repeat
            clk.PauseUSec(100)
            !outa[16]          
          
    This produces a signal on P16 that looks similar to the following timing diagram.

          P16 ─ 

                0   100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800  900   
                                   Time (µS)
          
    Notice how the edges of the signal do not line up with the shown time reference.  The
    pause method reliably delays for about 100 µS, but the rest of the loop (!outa[16] and
    repeat) take some time to execute also, causing the rising and falling edges to be
    slightly off of the shown time reference window.

    If the intention was for the rising and falling edges to be exactly lined up with our
    time reference window of 100 µS, then the MarkSync/WaitSync methods should be used.

    The following code performs the same toggling task as the previous example.  Note that
    "clk" is the nickname given to this Clock object and we are using an accurate, external
    clock source.

          dira[16]~~
          clk.MarkSync
          repeat
            clk.WaitSyncUSec(100)
            !outa[16]     
          
    This produces a signal on P16 that looks similar to the following timing diagram.

          P16 ─ 

                0   100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800  900   
                                   Time (µS)
           
    The MarkSync method marks a reference point in time (0 µS) and each call to
    WaitSyncUSec(100) waits until the next multiple of 100 µS from that reference point.
    As long as the loop isn't too long, this effectively compensates for the loop's
    overhead automatically, causing the !outa[16] statement to execute at exact 100 µS
    intervals.       
   

    
SETCLOCK METHOD EXPLANATION:
    This is a description of how the SetMode method works.  It is not necessary to
    understand this in order to use it, but the explanation is here for "the curious" since
    there's not enough "comment" room in the method itself.

    The SetMode method was written to accept the same clock        Clock Setting Constants

    Prior to version 1.2 of the Clock object, the clock setting   │  XTAL3   │   32  │  5  │
    expression was parsed and formed into the CLK Register value  │  XTAL2   │   16  │  4  │
    using the elemental bit meanings; however, that was found to  │  XTAL1   │    8  │  3  │

    To improve this, another study was performed on the binary    │  RCFAST  │    1  │  0  │
    patterns of the clock setting constants and the corresponding └──────────┴───────┴─────┘
    CLK Register values.  Through that effort, it was clear that
    a mapping from one to another is the most code-and-time-efficient translation.  With a
    conversion of the clock setting constant to a contiguous index, a simple array access
    is all that is needed to obtain the final value.

    Goal:     Clock Mode expression converted to index of 0..25.
    Purpose:  Reference 26-element array of CLK Register values.
              ie: Expression-to-Index-to-Array = proper CLK Register Value.

    Solution: [Refer to the table below during each bullet of this explanation, noting the
              values in each column]  This table shows Valid Clock Modes (expressions) and
              their binary value.  We'll apply the following operations on those values:
                • Using the Encode operator (>|) the raw value is converted to an "index"
                  value starting with 1..11, then repeating 7..11; close to our goal.
                • That encode operator took care of the leftmost high (1) bit in the value.
                  If the leftmost high bit is removed, isolating the leftover bits, an
                  Encode operation (iso >|) applied to the remaining bit pattern yields a
                  series of 0,3,4,5, and 6.
                • Then an additional transform on the previous result, subtracting 3 and
                  limiting result to a minimum of 0 (-3#>0), yields a series of 0, 1, 2,
                  and 3.
                • Multiplying the last result by 5 (*5) yields: 0, 5, 10, and 15.
                • Finally, adding that last result to that of the first result yields a
                  series of 1..26, or 0..25 (the goal) by simply subtracting 1.  Using
                  this value as the index into a prefilled array containing the
                  corresponding CLK Register values, returns the proper value needed to set
                  the clock.
                • The expression that performs the conversion of mode-to-index is given
                  below, where M is the clock mode value.  The isolation operation is
                  performed by xoring original with the decoded form of the original - 1,
                  or "^ (|<(>|M - 1))."

                    Idx := >|M + ( >|(M ^ (|<(>|M - 1))) - 3 #> 0 ) * 5 - 1
